## Analysing the Human Decision Making Process through iEEG data

Decision making is thought to involve a process of evidence accumula
tion, modelled as a drifting diffusion process, where the random walk is driven by the decision information. This modelling framework suggests that all single-stage decisions, perceptual and memory based, involve a similar evidence accumulation process. Inthis project, you will start from intracranially recorded EEGto examine whether different kinds of decisions (perceptual vs. memory) exhibit dynamics consistent with such drift diffusion models. 
In humans, accumulation processes have been studied as well, although in that case the challenge is the trade-off between poor temporal resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the poor spatial resolution of electroencephalograph (EEG).Intracranial EEG (iEEG)is data with a high degree ofspatial and temporal precision that can be obtained from epileptic patients who are implanted with electrodes for clinical purposes
